Single Dimensional Array: container for the elements
		10
		20
		40

		int[] array = {10, 20, 30};


Multi Dimensional Array: container for the arrays
                         if you have [][] two brackets
                         N dimensional array contains N-1 dimensional array
                         you can make infinite dimensions if you want

difference between single dimensional array is;
single dimensional array is for the elements, when you have multiple data to store.
multi dimensional array is for arrays when you store multiple arrays.
