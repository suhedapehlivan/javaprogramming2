Return methods
				return method vs void method







method: grouping code fragments ===> creating a function

			advantage: improves the re-usability of our codes


			                             MUST      MUST
		Access-Modifier   specifier   return-type  name  (Parameter){

					code fragments

		}

		Access modifier: public
				public: ALWAYS ACCESSIBLE

		Specifier: static
				static: method can be called through its class name


		ReturnType: void, any dataType
				void: does not return a value (a data)
				any dataType: MUST return a value (a data)

		Parameter: any dataType (if the method needs additional info to complete function)

		Method Name: meaningful, descriptive (just like variable name rules)




What's method? grouping code fragments ===> creating a function
What's void method? return type, void doest return a value(a data)
what's parameter? if the method needs additional info to complete function

What's return method?


return method: return type is not void
				MUST return a value


return statement: used for exiting the method
				 we can use it for returning a value from return methods


branching statements:
	continue: skipping the current iteration - loop
	break: exits the loop or switch
	return: exiting the method (one method, current method)
	System.exit(0): exits the system (EVERY THING WILL BE TERMINATED)
