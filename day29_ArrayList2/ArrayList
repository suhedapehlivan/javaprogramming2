Bulk Operations: argumnet MUST be a collection type

	addAll(CollectionType): adds collection of values to the arrayList
	removeAll(CollectionType): removes all the matching elements from the arraylist
	retainAll(CollectionType): removes all the non-matching elements from the arraylist
	containsAll(CollectionType): checks if all the elements are contained in the arraylist


Arrays:
	asList(array of values) ===> returns the array as collectionType




Remove functions:
	remove(): when we remove one element. DO NOT use it in the loop
	removeAll(): when we remove multiple elements ( if the elements that we want to remove are known)
	retainAll(): when we want to retain multiple elements (if the elements that we want to retain are known)
	removeIf(): when we remove under a condition (if the elements we want to remove are unknown)



Collections: utility class of collection

	sort()
	reverse()
	swap()
	max()
	min()
	replaceAll()
	frequency()
Collections: utility class of collection

	sort(ArrayListName)
	reverse(ArrayListName)
	swap(ArrayListName, index num1, index num2)
	max(ArrayListName)
	min(ArrayListName)
	replaceAll(ArrayListName, old value, newValue)
	frequency(ArrayListName, value)


Array vs ArrayList: both has index numbers

		ArrayList: size is not fixed
				   only supports non-primitives
				   Can not be multi-dimensional

		Array: size is fixed
			   supports both primitives & non-primitives
			   Can be multi-Dimensional
